# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP - a commonly used abbreviation for object-oriented programming encapsulation - one of the fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming is called **encapsulation**: you can combine functions and data all into a single entity. In object-oriented programming, this single entity is called a **class**. Encapsulation allows you to hide implementation details much like how the scikit-learn package hides the implementation of machine learning algorithms. In English, you might hear an attribute described as a property, description, feature, quality, trait, or characteristic. All of these are saying the same thing.
Accessing attributes directly would be frowned upon in many other languages but not in Python. Instead, the general object-oriented programming convention is to use methods to access attributes or change attribute values. These methods are called set and get methods or setter and getter methods. Refer to Properties vs. Getters and Setters


# Vocabulary

- **characteristic** would be a noun. 
- **action** would be a verb.

A few characteristics could be the dogâ€™s weight, color, breed, and height. These are all nouns. What actions would a dog take? A dog can bark, run, bite and eat. These are all verbs.

- **class** - a blueprint consisting of methods and attributes e.g. shirts, jeans, skirt could be all in class clothing

- **object** - an instance of a class. It can help to think of objects as something in the real world like a pencil, a dog, a shirt, etc.

- **attribute** - a descriptor or characteristic. Examples would be color, length, size, etc. These attributes can take on specific values like blue, 3 inches, large, etc.

- **method** - an action that a class or object could take



# Advanced OOP Topics

Here is a list of resources for advanced Python object-oriented programming topics.

- **class methods, instance methods, and static methods** - these are different types of methods that can be accessed at the class or object level

- **class attributes vs instance attributes** - you can also define attributes at the class level or at the instance level

- **multiple inheritance, mixins** - A class can inherit from multiple parent classes

- **Python decorators** - Decorators are a short-hand way for using functions inside other functions

# Making a Package

A package is a collection of Python modules. A Python package contained multiple files, a Python package also needs an __init__.py file.
